How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff shows a difference between the version that worked fine and 
	the version that doesn't work fine.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Using version control system make me do fewer mistakes and revert files if I need.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Because it depends on many variables, only developer can choose the right 
	size of the commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Google Docs is not vcs at all.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows us all commits in the repo, git diff gives us the opportunity 
	to see what was changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
